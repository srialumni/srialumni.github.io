							<p><strong>Purpose</strong>: To promote interactions with SRI and other alumni for mutual benefit.</p>
							<p><b>Vision</b>: Alumni interacting with SRI staff by providing institutional memory, mentoring, and other support, as well as by participating in meetings and social occasions.</p>

<h4>August 2025 Incorporation Plans and Election Update</h4>
<p>The Alumni Association Steering Committee is moving toward
changing the basis for this Association; namely, toward
a nonprofit incorporated association. <a href="../election/">Nominations for
officers is now open</a> and online voting will happen in time
to have results announced at the <a href="../events/">Reunion</a>. As a bonus, we
hope to soon be able to accept online/credit card dues
payments. <a href="../election/">Learn more.</a></p>

						  <h1 class="mb-10">Structure and Activities</h1>

						  <p><b>Membership</b>: All SRI alumni and spouses are eligible for membership. Membership is free the first year. After that, a small annual membership fee enables the Association to be self-supporting. Fees and donations are primarily used to pay for publication and mailing costs, and for the <a href="../events/index.html">Spring Fling and Annual Reunions</a>. All <a href="../steering/index.html">officers of the Association</a> serve on a volunteer, non-compensated basis. The committee prepares an annual financial statement published each year in the April issue of the member <a href="../newsletters/index.html">newsletter</a>.</p>

						  <p><b>Organization</b>: The SRI Alumni Association is an official SRI organization. Activities are directed by a steering committee of alumni representatives who work with SRIâ€™s vice president of human resources. The steering committee meets at least quarterly but usually on a monthly basis. Committee members nominally serve for three years but may serve longer if a suitable replacement cannot be identified and the member agrees to serve. Inactive committee members may be removed by a majority vote of the committee.</p>

						  <p><b>Communications</b>: Association members will be kept informed of SRI and alumni news and activities through periodic mailings and/or emails.</p>

						  <p><b>Social Occasions</b>: All SRI Alumni Association members are invited to the Annual Meeting, which is normally held on a business day to facilitate contact between members and staff. Other social occasions may be arranged by association members.</p>

						  <p><b>Use of SRI Resources</b>: The association has access to SRI resources for communication with members. The association pays for paper and postage charges. Individual SRI alumni do not have access to SRI or its resources for personal use.</p>

						  <p><b>Archives</b>. The association stores important areas of SRI history, including SRI research journals and staff publications, phone books and annual reports, and all photographic material up to the start of digital photography. Our archives are home to thousands of items. To learn more about how SRI has influenced numerous industries and society, see the <a href="https://www.sri.com/timeline-of-innovation">SRI Timeline of Innovation</a>. If you have any photographs, documents, reports or other interesting and historically important SRI materials, please contact us. We also welcome assistance in organizing and refining our print and photographic collection at the SRI headquarters in Menlo Park.</b>

						  <p><b>SRI Golf Club</b>. The SRI Golf Club enjoys monthly golf tournaments at different courses around the Bay Area and a year-end club banquet. Membership consists of men and women of all skill levels who enjoy golf and camaraderie. Membership is open to all SRI staff and family, alumni and their friends. Annual dues include membership in the Northern California Golf Association. Find out more about the club by contacting Sandy Hinzmann at sandyhgolf@gmail.com..</p>

						  <p><b>SRI Federal Credit Union</b>. The SRI Federal Credit Union provides SRI staff members and alumni with convenient, low-cost, full service banking activities. For more information, contact the <a href="https://www.srifcu.org/">SRI Federal Credit Union</a>.</p>
